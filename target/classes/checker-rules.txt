Checker Rules

Pawn moves:
Pawn move and capture only diagonally forwards.

Kings moves:
They move and capture diagonally forwards or backwards, but they canÂ´t jump over empty cells.

Forced Captures:
If a player is in a position to capture a piece, they must do so, even on any subsequent jump. If more than one capturing move is available the user decides.

Particularities about the end of the game:
If all of the pieces for a given player have been removed from the board, the game ends and the opposing player wins.
Similarly if a player cannot make another valid move, the game is over and the opposing player wins
